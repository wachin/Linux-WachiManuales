VTE Configuration
Background

Tilix uses a GTK+ 3 widget called VTE (Virtual Terminal Emulator). The VTE widget was originally designed as the back-end for Gnome Terminal but was fortunately designed as a GTK widget so that other terminal emulator applications could leverage it instead of rolling their own. Many popular Linux terminal emulators use this component.



1. Source vte.sh in bashrc

Update ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc if you are using zsh) to execute vte.sh directly, this involves adding the following line at the end of the file.


yo busqué en:

/etc/profile.d/

y econtré:

vte-2.91.sh

y por eso se puse:



if [ $TILIX_ID ] || [ $VTE_VERSION ]; then
        source /etc/profile.d/vte-2.91.sh
fi




y funcionó
