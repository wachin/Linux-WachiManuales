I am using Linux Ubuntu (18.04) Since I started using Ubuntu I can not watch Netflix, when playing netflix I come to a page abut demands of "HTML5" and "Silvernight" player. Is there anyone who knows a way fixing this and play Netflix on Linux with Opera Browser?

Hi @jwalker8 You can add the the line/repo: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/canonical-chromium-builds/stage/ubuntu ubuntu-name-matching-your-mint-version* main to your /etc/apt/sources.list, and update the package (it's already @132 there), or simply download the appropriate pkg for you Ubuntu version from here:

http://ppa.launchpad.net/canonical-chromium-builds/stage/ubuntu/pool/main/c/chromium-browser/?C=M;O=D

, and install it manually.
* e.g. bionic.

By the way: the version .100 is still working here, when I add a symbolic link to the lib in "/opera's-installation-root/lib_extra/link-to-the-libffmpeg.so".
