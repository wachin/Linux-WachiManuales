Open the Advanced Settings and found under Privacy (Content Settings) users can now manage how PDF documents are opened.
Enter URL chrome://settings/content
Scroll down to PDF Documents > Enable "Open PDF files in the default PDF viewer application"
Finished to save changes
I believe this is Google's correct way for Chrome users to disable built-in PDF viewer, and to confirm, Chrome PDF Viewer will be disabled by Enterprise Policy (greyed out) under Chrome Plugins.
