If slowdowns didn't go away even after Chrome restart, open chrome://flags (put this in the Chrome address bar and press Enter) and set up following:

accelerated 2D canvas – Disable
GPU rasterization - Disable
Zero-copy rasterizer - Disable 


en linux el siguiente no aparece:


Hardware-accelerated video decode - Disable


Reset Google Chrome:

Click the Chrome Menu on the toolbar and then click "Settings."

Select "Show Advanced Settings" from the bottom of the page and then click "Reset Browser Settings."

Click "Reset" to revert your browser configuration to default.



A trick I learned from a few sites:

Use –-purge-memory-button in Chrome's command line and click Purge memory in Chrome's task manager and it will free up memory (if possible)
Obviously, just disable extensions and that'll save you memory as well.

Also, some sites have mentioned FooTab, an extenstion that pauses all other tabs upon startup until loaded.
