I am not sure if it works for all models, but on mine if you press Fn+Esc it changes the Fn lock so that F1+F12 work as normal and when you hold Fn+(lets say F11) it will change the brightness or whatever that keys secondary function is. Pressing Fn+Esc again reverts it back to default. Hope this helps.
