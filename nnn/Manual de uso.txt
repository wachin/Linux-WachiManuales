Launch applications

GUI applications can be launched using a drop-down menu using plugin launch. nnn picks it up from the plugin location. If launch is not found, nnn shows a regular prompt for the application executable name.

To configure launch as an independent app launcher add a keybind to open launch in a terminal e.g.,

xfce4-terminal -e "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins/launch

GUI applications can also be launched from the prompt. Use & to launch in background so nnn isn't blocked.

Note:

    You can also launch an instance of your favorite terminal in the current directory (open terminal here...) this way.

Open as root

If you are a sudoer, open a new instance of nnn from the built-in prompt with sudo nnn.

You can also have a short and sweet (but powerful) alias (which also works at the nnn prompt):

alias N='sudo -E nnn -dH'
