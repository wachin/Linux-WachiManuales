In this tutorial, I'll show you How to find all the used IP addresses on a network.
Generally, nmap is useful to quickly scan networks.
To install nmap, enter
sudo apt-get install nmap
Once it is installed, enter
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
This will show you which hosts responded to ping requests on the network between 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255.
Netdiscover can also be used
To install via terminal:
sudo apt-get install netdiscover

sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
An IP with MAC Addreses will show on your terminal
