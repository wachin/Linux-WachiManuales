D.3.4.6. Configure Locales and Keyboard
To configure your locale settings to use a language other than English, install the locales support package and configure it. Currently the use of UTF-8 locales is recommended.

# apt install locales
# dpkg-reconfigure locales
To configure your keyboard (if needed):

# apt install console-setup
# dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration 
Note that the keyboard cannot be set while in the chroot, but will be configured for the next reboot.
