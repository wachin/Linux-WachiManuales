This version is an early release, and is by no means complete.

From version 1.0 and on, twofold suffix stripping is used. This greatly reduces the size of the package, and the complexity of the generation. 
The 170000+ words .dic was reduced to about 3000 words.

From version 1.0 there is also a basic hyphenator included.
