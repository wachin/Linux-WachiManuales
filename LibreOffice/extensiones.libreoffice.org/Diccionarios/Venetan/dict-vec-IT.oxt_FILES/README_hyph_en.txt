There is no explicit hyphenation exception list because these patterns
proved to hyphenate correctly a very large set of words suitably chosen in
order to test them in the most heavy circumstances.

Nevertheless if you frequently use technical terms that you want hyphenated
differently from what is normally done (for example if you prefer
etymological hyphenation of prefixed and/or suffixed words) you should
insert a specific hyphenation list in the preamble of your document, for
example:

\hyphenation{su-per-in-du-tor su-per-in-du-to-ri}

If you use, as you should, the venetan option of the babel package, then you
have available the active character that allows you to put a discretionary
break at a word boundary of a compound word while maintaning the hyphenation
algorithm on the rest of the word.

Should you find any word that gets hyphenated in a wrong way, please, AFTER
CHECKING ON A RELIABLE MODERN DICTIONARY, report to the author, preferably
by email.
