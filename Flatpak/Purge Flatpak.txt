sudo rm -r -f /var/lib/flatpak/

reiniciar y allí si se puede instalar alguna aplicación


Additional info on how to uninstall the package manager Flatpack
As I also wanted to uninstall the package manager Flatpak as well I took the time to look up how to do that and thought I would collect it here as a future reference for anyone in need of this info.

In short:

Uninstalling flatpak and its dependencies

sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove flatpak
Purging the config/data too

sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove flatpak
More info here: http://installion.co.uk/ubuntu/yakkety/universe/f/flatpak/uninstall/index.html

After that I did check the /var/lib/flatpak where Flatpak resides, and to my shock I discovered the folder took up a whooping 4.2 GB of massive space, all that after a couple of days trying it out and having 3 programs installed (Atom, Audacity, Gimp).

Looking around the internet one will come across a few comments on this matter how much space Flatpak uses and fails to clean up after itself after uninstalling it.

More on this here: https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/1391

Anyhow, I went on and deleted the folder and its content with the following line:

rm -r -f /var/lib/flatpak/
Obs! Be careful with this command, read more on how to remove folders and its content here: How do I remove a folder?

There is one more folder with, in my case, a tiny amount of data which I also removed.

/home/YourUserName/.local/share/flatpak/
I think that should have most traces and data of Flatpack removed.

And as noted by @mook765 in his comment above I had to change from

flatpak --user uninstall io.atom.Atom
to..

flatpak --system uninstall io.atom.Atom
to get the program uninstalled.
