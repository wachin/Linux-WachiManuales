Search option on dolphin File Manager not working in other partitions - UbuntuStudio 15.04


I use the file manager Dolphin UbuntuStudio from version 12.04 and then 14.04 and to activate the search option I have to install: 'systemsettings' via synaptic next configured in the search options and worked (the option was created there in the Configuration Manager), but now in the release 15.04 I found a way to make working (only not work in other partitions):



Install this via synaptic: 

dolphin
baloo-utils 
kde-config-baloo-advanced 

Ok, now the dolphin file search is already enabled only in HOME.


I thy to enable to search in other partitions but not working

I put this command in a terminal: 

kcmshell4 kcm_baloofileadv 

will open a window and there you will see a "Folders" tab, HOME is already added by default, to add the other partitions, see my example:

Now I add my other two partitions:

But not working.

I know this command to disable the search in other partitions or folders:

kcmshell4 kcm_baloofile 

Well, for instance here I put a picture of the list of packages that I have installed:

The search on HOME working fine but in other partitions not working.
