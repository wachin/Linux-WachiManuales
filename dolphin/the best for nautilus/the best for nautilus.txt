to work with list- or detail-view in nautilus so you need to install:

it is important that you recorded in your memory the name of that package "dconf-editor" for you easy use in next times

Oh, I said you a new. In the repositories of 15.10 there is a package called dolphin4, this software I use to my main file manager, this is the same that dolphin but working the search option. I know is necessary to install dome services, but is very fantanstic. If you try to use it, I made some tutorials for the most necessary config:

Extraer aquí - Comprimir (File-Roller) para dolphin

Añadir enqueue (a la cola de reproducción) al menu contextual del administrador de archivos dolphin

other importantly:

kubuntu - Enabling PDF preview in Dolphin - Ask Ubuntu
http://askubuntu.com/questions/86338/enabling-pdf-preview-in-dolphin
from this I install:  kdegraphics-thumbnailers
