This should be this Intel graphics driver bug: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84372

Workaround (from comment #7):
Create a file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf with the following content:

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "AccelMethod"  "sna"
    Option      "TearFree"    "true"
EndSection

... then restart X.

Sorry, copy-paste mistake :

On Debian Jessie, I can confirm that upgrading xserver-xorg-video-intel from the version in stable (2.21.15-2+b2) to the version in backports (2.99.917-2~bpo8+1 0) is solving the problem.
