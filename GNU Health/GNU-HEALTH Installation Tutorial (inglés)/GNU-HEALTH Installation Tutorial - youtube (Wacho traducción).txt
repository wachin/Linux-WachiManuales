Hello, this tutorial1 is to show you how to install GNUHEALTH on Ubuntu.

I am using Ubuntu-GNOME-15.10

The commands should be the same for any other flavor of Ubuntu, so do not worry.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


First, open up your terminal, and get root previlages (sudo -s)

To do so, Press Ctrl+Alt+T

Now after you gained root, type in the following command, to install the required packages:

apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip \
    libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev python-ldap bsdtar \
    python-imaging python2.7-cracklib postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libjpeg-dev

PS: Don't worry about typing the command, you can find it in the description below!

I have already installed the packages,

So the next step would be adding a new user (the GNUHEALTH user)

I will call it, tutorial1, but feel free to name it as you wish.

To do so type in the following command:

adduser gnuhealth

PLEASE DO NOT FORGET THE PASSWORD YOU SET FOR THIS USER!

Now the user is added!

Next step is to ensure the PSQL authentication is set to "trust"

To do so, first of all, we have to find the "hba" file.

Type in this command to get its path:

su - postgres -c "psql -t -P format=unaligned -c 'show hba_file'"

The path where my "hba" file is: /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf
Please note that you might get a different, yet similar path.

Now we need to access that file

gedit /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf

Please make sure that you have a matching configuration with "TRUST" methods as I will show you! (Change your file accordingly)



Now, we need to add a database user with certain previlages.

Type in this command:

su - postgres -c "createuser --createdb --no-createrole --no-superuser gnuhealth"


Downloading and Installing GNU Health[edit]

warning
Do the folowing steps with your newly created gnuhealth user, DO NOT use root.

Running the GNU Health Installer[edit]

Become user gnuhealth:

su - gnuhealth 
cd $HOME

Now go to its HOME directory

Here, we need to download the latest version of GNUHEALTH

Type in this command:

wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/health/gnuhealth-latest.tar.gz

Now we have to extract the contents of the tarball using this command:

tar xzf gnuhealth-latest.tar.gz

Notice that now we have a folder named gnuhealth-***-**


Enter that folder:

cd gnuhealth-*

Here there are a lot of files which make up our GNUHEALTH version.

WE need to start the installer using this command:

./gnuhealth-setup install

THis installation will take a few minutes depending on your bandwidth and machine...

This is a part of the installation, towards the end....
It is installing the server (Tryton)

Now use the same password you put for your user! Do not forget it!!

************
PASSWORD
************

El password que yo le puse cuando añadí el usuario gnuhealth es:

Cuiraa

Now we have installed GNUHEALTH successfully

WE're not done yet!!!

Now we need to enable the BASH environment for your created user:

source "$HOME"/.gnuhealthrc



Now, we can run files from the deep directories of Tryton without always accessing folders and stuff.

For example, we are going to edit the configuration file of Tryton.

Type in the same terminal, editconf

This will open a vi editor (old version of vim)

And we need to edit this to enable several machines to request data from the server.

If you're not comfortable with vim, you may use gedit or nano.

We will add the following segment to the config file.

[jsonrpc]
listen = *:8000

After that, we are almost done to launch our first GNUHEALTH session!

WE need to create a db that will save our records, or else GNUHealth will not work!

createdb --encoding=unicode tutorial1database

You may name your db whatever you like, I am using the name tutorial1database, And this must be executed as the database user we created!

Now we will start the server

Type in: cdexe

Now, type in: ./trytond --verbose

You may wish to ommit the verbose part, but I recommend it as you will see what is going on in the sever...

You will see something like this: 
4188 -1220032768 [2016-03-05 08:24:31,956] INFO trytond.server using /home/tutorial1/gnuhealth/tryton/server/config/trytond.conf as configuration file
4188 -1220032768 [2016-03-05 08:24:31,957] INFO trytond.server initialising distributed objects services
4188 -1220032768 [2016-03-05 08:24:32,119] INFO trytond.server starting JSON-RPC protocol on *:8000

Which means you're server is up and running!!! COngratulations!

Now the last step, we will download the Tryton CLient...

Open a new Terminal (the first one now is the running server)

apt-get install tryton-client

This will install your tryton client.

Now we will run the client! And try to connect it to the server!

Type in: tryton-client on your terminal and you will see it pop-up


Now you will go to manage profiles, and create your own!




Add a new profile, give it a name, your host will be  localhost:8000 as you specified in the configuration file

A "Create" will popup if you followed the steps.

CLick on create!

Use the SAME PASSWORD you've been using throughout the tutorial1!

Give the DB a name of your choice and USE THE SAME PASSWORD FOR THE ADMIN PASSWORD!

Click create!

That was the server, it takes a few minutes, its the first launch...


Now login with your newly created credentials, and WELCOME TO GNUHEALTH!!


As seen in the video, you can add users and configure their roles, and add modules and disable modules!

Watch the next video to learn how to use GNUHEALTH!!


Thank you for watching, I hope WE HELPED!

AUB - E-health
