apport-gtk


Take a look and delete all files in /var/crash/:

rm /var/crash/*
I suddenly had the same problem apport-gtk taking 100% on every restart.

Seemed there was a huge (2GB+) bogus crash file in /var/crash/ that couldn't be parsed. After several minutes of waiting I always ended up with this rather mysterious dialog:

This problem report is damaged and cannot be processed. Error('Incorrect padding',)
After I deleted the file in /var/crash/ both issues were gone.
