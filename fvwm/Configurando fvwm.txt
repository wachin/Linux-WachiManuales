Did adding the word Test to line 591 of your configuration fix the swallowing issue with Stalonetray?

If you want stalonetray to show a battery icon, you can sudo apt-get install fdpowermon, it will go in your tray and provide you with a battery icon.

For volume, if you use pulse audio, you could sudo apt-get install pasystray.

For the position of the tray, the geometry string controls where the FvwmButtons window will be. So -0-0 would get you the bottom right, as opposed to your current -0+0 which is top right (line 573). So try this for line 573:

*RightPanel: Geometry 120x$[vp.height]-0-0

Make sure you update your fvwm config to launch pasystray and fdpowermon if you want them. For example:

AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Exec exec pasystray
+ I Exec exec fdpowermon



Para ponerlo a la izquierda:

*RightPanel: Geometry 120x$[vp.height]+0-0
