Trouble with batch conversion of .png to .pdf using convert - Ask Ubuntu

As vanadium posted, you have to change the ImageMagick policy.

sudo vim /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
and replace the line

<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
with

<policy domain="coder" rights="read|write" pattern="PDF" />
If you only want to allow write, and not read, you can also erase the read| part in the line above.
