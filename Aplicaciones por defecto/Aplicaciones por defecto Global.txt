nautilus - How do I change the default application for unknown file types? - Ask Ubuntu
https://askubuntu.com/questions/65009/how-do-i-change-the-default-application-for-unknown-file-types

modify ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list

[Default Applications] 
- text/plain=bless.desktop
- application/octet-stream=bless.desktop
+ application/octet-stream=gedit.desktop
This reverts the text/plain app to using the system default in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list, and changes the default application/octet-stream. It seems that Firefox labels this mime-type as "Unknown".
