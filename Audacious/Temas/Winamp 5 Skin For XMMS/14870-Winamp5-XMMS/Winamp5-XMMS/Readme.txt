Finally I can pronounce that there will be no more changes of the skin. I would like to thank everyone who was involved in this project, especially wildrose-wally and GuidoD. Usually it’s difficult to get good results when so many people are involved in one project, but in this case I must say we did an excellent job.

Couple of days ago I've installed winamp 5 and amazed by the look of the new skin. Since I am fan of standard winamp 2.9 shape I've decided to redesign Sven's fantastic skin to 2.9 shape. Hope one day he will do an original version.
