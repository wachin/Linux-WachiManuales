It is actually very simple, the window viewport position information is relative to the current viewport.

So, just type xwininfo and select a window.
Now, change the viewport and type xwininfo -id 0x... (0x... is the id you collected for the window), the position values will show as outside of the current viewport limits, with relative values based on current viewport like:

Absolute upper-left X:  -1270
Absolute upper-left Y:  62
Based on this is possible to determine where the window is.
In this case I was on viewport 1 and the window on viewport 0.
