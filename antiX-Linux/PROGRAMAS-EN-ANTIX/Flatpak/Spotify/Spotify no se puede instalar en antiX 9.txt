I have this:

- Laptop Dell Inspiron 1750
- antiX 9, 32 bits

I install flatpak:

sudo apt-get install flatpak xdg-desktop-portal-gtk

When I run Spotify Flatpak:

flatpak run com.spotify.Client

give my this:

$ /app/extra/share/spotify/spotify: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4: no version information available (required by /app/extra/share/spotify/spotify)
/proc/self/exe: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4: no version information available (required by /proc/self/exe)
[1029/110217.770217:ERROR:sandbox_linux.cc(344)] InitializeSandbox() called with multiple threads in process gpu-process.

The program appear with the login windown, but can't do facebook login. 

it seem to be neccesary have installed

libcurl3

but in antiX9 there is

libcurl4

I don't know how to solve this.


However is posible to do login without facebook, then the program appear normally, but when I want to play a song appear this message in Spotify:

"The song is not available. If you have the file on your computer you can import it"

in the terminal appear:

"ALSA lib ../../pulse/pulse.c:243:(pulse_connect) PulseAudio: Unable to connect: Conexi√≥n negada"

I search in synaptic and pulseaudio is not installed. I have to considerate install it to hear sound
