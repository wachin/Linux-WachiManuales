KDE connect cannot detect my phone
https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=160294


 Hello
I installed KDE connect on my linux box (UBUNTU 16.04 LTS with Unity)

uname -a
Linux <hostname> 4.13.0-32-generic #35~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jan 25 10:13:43 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

KDE connect indicator version is 0.1-0~41~ubuntu16.04.1 from LP-PPA-vikoadi

My phone is Pixel 3, Android 9, KDE connect client version is 1.12

The device never appears in the list of recognized devices on kdeconnect settings
I wonder what should be done or checked. Are there any recommendations on how to get more diagnostics (especially from the phone).
Maybe there are logs available or a way to run service and client in debug mode
Any help/advice would be appreciated.

See diagnostics below
A bit of diagnostics (the required ports are allowed in iptables, firewall is not running)

1. devices are on the same network and I can mutually ping each other.


2.
ps -ef|grep kdec

5. Are the ports open/blocked?
netcat -z -v <your-phones-ip> 1714-1764 # Try phone and laptop, use port which netstat shows

Example output:
Connection to <your -phones-ip> 1716 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
+ lots of Connection refused, but you need 1 "succeeded"

6. Check the kdeconnect home dir
ls -al /home/<user>/.config/kdeconnect/
