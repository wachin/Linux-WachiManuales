How to use JACK and Pulseaudio/ALSA at the same time on the same audio device? - Ask Ubuntu

It might be much easier now. What worked for me today, to satisfy my really basic needs, after a fresh install of Linux Mint 18.2 (Ubuntu 16.04 package base) was:

Use Synaptic to install QSynth and QJackCtl.

Copy required sound font(s) into an appropriate folder such as /usr/share/sounds/sf2/

In QSynth Setup: under Audio tab change Audio Driver to pulseaudio.

In QSynth Setup: under SoundFonts: Open... and select one as required.

In QJackCtl Setup > Settings > Advanced:

Server Prefix: pasuspsender -- /usr/bin/jackd

In QJackCtl Setup > Options:

Execute script after startup:

pactl load-module module-jack-sink channels=2; pactl load-module module-jack-source; pacmd set-default-sink jack_out


In QJackCtl Connect: ALSA: join the keyboard entry on the left to FLUID Synth on the right.

In the main System Settings for Sound, select the required output device.

Now I can play the keyboard while watching a video (e.g. on YouTube using Firefox for example) - previously I could only do one of these at a time without a lot of tweaks I could seldom keep track of.

Hope that helps someone, or encourages them to try again :-).
