I have this:

- Laptop Dell Inspiron 1750
- antiX 9, 32 bits

I install flatpak:

[code]sudo apt-get install flatpak xdg-desktop-portal-gtk 
[/code]

I install kdenlive flatpak:

[code]flatpak install flathub org.kde.kdenlive[/code]

When I run Kdenlive Flatpak give my this:

[code]flatpak run org.kde.kdenlive
"Session bus not found\nTo circumvent this problem try the following command (with Linux and bash)\nexport $(dbus-launch)"[/code]

Then I run:

[code]export $(dbus-launch)[/code]

Next:

[code]flatpak run org.kde.kdenlive[/code]

then give my this:

[code]Note that the directories 

'/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share'
'/home/wachin/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share'

are not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so
applications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the
session is restarted.[/code]

The Kdenlive flatpak appear but close unexpectedly:

And I search a Workingaround, and I found this:

[quote][b]flatpak directories not added to XDG_DATA_DIRS on Plasma + Wayland

My XDG_DATA_DIRS looks like this:
```
â–¶ env | grep XDG_DATA_DIRS
XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share:/usr/share:/usr/local/share
```

I switched to Plasma under Wayland recently, don't know if it is important. I'm
running Debian Buster (mostly) with some third party packages and some from
sid.

This presumably means your session startup won't source
/etc/X11/Xsession.d/20flatpak like an X11 session would. GNOME in Wayland
mode doesn't do that either, so at least they're consistent.

Setting environment variables during session startup is, unfortunately,
still a bit of a mess. Flatpak tries to add its directories to
XDG_DATA_DIRS in several ways:

- /etc/X11/Xsession.d/20flatpak (X11-specific)
- /etc/profile.d/flatpak.sh (shell-specific)
- /usr/share/gdm/env.d/flatpak.env (GNOME/GDM-specific)

but apparently Plasma in Wayland mode doesn't use any of those.

Perhaps the answer is for Flatpak to have a systemd environment generator,
systemd.environment-generator(7), instead of or in addition to the
hooks we currently have? That would leave out sysvinit users, but that
isn't necessarily a huge problem, because they probably aren't using
Wayland anyway.

Or if there is a Plasma-specific mechanism similar to the GDM-specific
/usr/share/gdm/env.d (which is used by GNOME in Wayland mode) then
Flatpak could use that too, but I'd need details of that mechanism.

Actually, it has had one of these since 1.1.3, so that can't be it. Please
check whether /usr/lib/systemd/user-environment-generators/60-flatpak is
getting run when you log in?

 This appear to be a important info but I don't know how to do something to solve the problem
 
 
 Then I found in 

[quote][b]About something being printed during installation or update of apps #533

Weird. Just to check, when you've logged in, what is the value of the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable?

I'm still seeing this message:

flatpak --user --assumeyes update

Note that '/home/user/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share' is not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_HOME and XDG_DATA_DIRS

The odd thing is that it seem to be correctly set for the session:

echo $XDG_DATA_DIRS

/usr/share/budgie-desktop:/home/user/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share:/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share:/usr/local/share:/usr/share:/var/lib/snapd/desktop

And it seems to be set correctly by this X-session init script:

/etc/X11/Xsession.d/20flatpak

What is triggering the warning? It seems like a false positive; all install flatpak apps seem to fire up and work just fine...[/quote]

Interesting. Now I have see this in the terminal:

This meaning that is neccesarry pulseaudio, Now I go to install it:
