How to Enable Backports Repository on Debian
https://www.comoinstalarlinux.com/como-usar-el-editor-nano-linux/2/

Open a terminal emulator, and find the codename of your Debian installation:

lsb_release -sc

debian-backports-lsb-release

Note: in this example the codename is “stretch.” If at the time you read this the codename is different, for example “buster,” replace every occurence where you see “stretch” with “buster.”

Debian’s APT package manager stores the list of repositories where it can download software in a file. View and edit this file with the following command:

sudo apt edit-sources

At the end of the file, add the following line:

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main contrib non-free

sudo apt-get update
