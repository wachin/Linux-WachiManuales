Fluxbox Tray Menu

If you want a fast way to reach your Fluxbox menus when you're using all your screen, your problems are over.
Now you can use the Fluxbox Tray Menu to put a icon on your toolbar, and when clicking with the left button, your Fluxbox menus will appear!
It's very simple to use.

Download the sources, install it with

    ./configure
    make
    make install

insert the icon reference to it, using your Fluxbox menu file, as

    [begin] (TaQ's box) </home/taq/icons/fb.xpm> 

execute the ftmenu file or put it in your .xinitrc file, and it's done. :-)
