arter97/exfat-linux: exFAT filesystem module for Linux kernel
https://github.com/arter97/exfat-linux



Manually installing the module

    Download the code

    git clone https://github.com/arter97/exfat-linux
    cd exfat-linux

    Build

    make

    Install

    sudo make install

This will install the module to your currently running kernel.

If you're running a v5.4+ kernel, it is highly recommended to reboot at this point to prevent the existing staging exFAT drivers to load.

    And finally load

    sudo modprobe exfat

If you upgrade the kernel, you'll have to repeat this process.

If you want to update exfat-linux to the latest version, you'll have to repeat this process.
