Trying to do the same thing as the original poster (get rid of a bad stereo channel). 

Can't find that "Stereo to Mono" effect mentioned above, or was it only added to MLT? 

Otherwise, tried with "copy channels", but can't get what I want (copy one of the original channels to both output channels).
