Unlike the solution proposed by kk78, the following method solves the problem once and for all:
Close dropbox

Open /usr/bin/dropbox file with a text editor (as an admin). For example, in the terminal run

sudo gedit /usr/bin/dropbox

Create a new line after import os and add the following: 

os.environ['DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS'] = ""

    Save
