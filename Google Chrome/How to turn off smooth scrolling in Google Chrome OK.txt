To disable smooth scrolling, do the following:

Load chrome://flags/#smooth-scrolling in the browser's address bar and hit enter. This takes you directly to the preference on the flags page.
Alternatively, open chrome://flags directly, hit F3, and search for smooth scrolling to find it this way.
Click on the disable link to turn the feature off. A restart button is displayed at the bottom which you need to click on to complete the process.
