 

I install ksnip on Linux from source in antiX 9 (this are based inDebian 10 Buster) 32 bit version

I install this dependences:

sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential libqt5x11extras5-dev qt5-qmake qt5-default qtbase5-dev-tools extra-cmake-modules qtdeclarative5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev qtcreator qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools

Next Install in this order:

kColorPicker

    Put in the terminal:
    $ git clone https://github.com/DamirPorobic/kColorPicker
    Change to repo directory:
    $ cd kColorPicker
    Make new build directory and enter it:
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    Create the makefile and build the project:
    $ cmake .. && make
    Install shared library (not required when only using the example):
    $ sudo make install
    Run the example application:
    $ ./example/kColorPicker-example

Working fine


kImageAnnotator

    Put in the terminal:
    $ git clone https://github.com/DamirPorobic/kImageAnnotator
    Change to repo directory:
    $ cd kImageAnnotator
    Make new build directory and enter it:
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    Create the makefile and build the project:
    $ cmake .. && make
    Install shared library (not required when only using the example):
    $ sudo make install
    Run the example application:
    $ ./example/kImageAnnotator-example

Working fine

ksnip

    Put in the terminal:
    $ git clone https://github.com/DamirPorobic/ksnip
    Change to repo directory:
    $ cd ksnip
    Make new build directory and enter it:
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    Create the makefile and build the project:
    $ cmake .. && make
    Now install the application, eventually you need to run it with sudo:
    $ sudo make install
    Run the application:
    $ ksnip
 
Working fine when I take snapshots, but when I open wherever picture file from ksnip, this freeze


Now I think to prove other version and I manually uninstall deleting manually with sudo thunar this:

/usr/local/bin/ksnip
/usr/local/share/ksnip/
/usr/local/share/applications/ksnip.desktop
/usr/local/share/pixmaps/ksnip.svg
/usr/local/share/metainfo/ksnip.appdata.xml


Then I install ksnip from this source:

https://github.com/DamirPorobic/ksnip/archive/v1.5.0.tar.gz

I extract this and go to this path:

/home/wachin/github/ksnip-1.5.0/

then I build:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake .. && make
    $ sudo make install
    
Install fine, but when I launch it:

    $ ksnip
    
The program start but is the 1.6 alpha version, then I said to me, this are not possible and go to delete all program manually:

manually with sudo thunar I delete this:

/usr/local/bin/ksnip
/usr/local/share/ksnip/
/usr/local/share/applications/ksnip.desktop
/usr/local/share/pixmaps/ksnip.svg
/usr/local/share/metainfo/ksnip.appdata.xml

And now I put in terminal:

    $ ksnip
    
And Ksnip open, but this are not possible because I uninstall it from /bin/ksnip

What happen here I don't know

Here I made a video to try explain the problem

God Bless
