Calligra Suite is a free office suite for GNU/Linux. Calligra is available in Ubuntu repository. This article introduce steps to install the whole Calligra Suite and to install one by one main component (such as Words or Krita) of it.
  


Install Complete Calligra Suite

It is the all in one solution but it is very huge. It needs about 180 MB to download and 500 MB to install in Ubuntu 16.04 32 bit. To install the whole packages of Calligra Suite, perform this command:
sudo apt-get install calligra

Install Partial Calligra Suite

It is the specific solution, it needs less size of packages, but it is still about 100 MB to install in every main component of Calligra. For example, to install only Calligra Words, you will need to download about 100 MB and its installed-size is 300 MB.
